This is project is a custom component for supporting Casambi Lights in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). All lights will be automatically discovered. The light state is sent to Home Assistant mainly by websocket, but this integration also polls Casambis REST API periodically. Home Assistant can be integrated with [Google Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_assistant/), [Amazon Alexa](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa/) and much more.

It uses a separate library (also written by me), link to library project:
