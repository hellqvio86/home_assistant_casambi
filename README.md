## Deprecation

> [!WARNING]
> Casambi has stopped handing out API keys to end users, its highly encouraged to consider the bluetooth custom component for Casambi [casambi-bt-hass](https://github.com/lkempf/casambi-bt-hass) if not on legacy firmware.

This is project is a custom component for supporting Casambi Lights in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). The component integrates with casambi through its [Cloud API](https://developer.casambi.com/). All lights will be automatically discovered. The light state is sent to Home Assistant mainly by websocket, but this integration also polls Casambis REST API periodically. Home Assistant can be integrated with [Google Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_assistant/), [Amazon Alexa](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa/) and much more.

It uses a separate library (also written by me), link to library project:
